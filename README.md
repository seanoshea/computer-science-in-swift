### computer-science-in-swift
The overwhelming majority of the actual code and logic for this repo is taken directly from https://github.com/nzakas/computer-science-in-javascript. The intent behind this repository of code is an attempt to try and translate logic from JavaScript into Swift.

### Other repos
Fiddling around with sorting and data structures in Swift isn't exactly a new idea. Check out https://github.com/jessesquires/swift-sorts for some other Swift-based sorting algorithms.
